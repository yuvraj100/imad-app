                Lets begin with a quick introduction to C. Our aim is to learn the concept of C deeply and implement that concepts and logics in real program.
                C is a general-purpose language. It has been closely associated with the UNIX system where it was developed, since both Sytem and most of the programs that run on it are written in C-lanugaue. The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system or machine; and although it has been called a "System Programming Language" because it is useful to writing compilers and Opearting systems, it has been used equally well to write major programs in many different domains.

                C provides the fundamental control flow constructions required for well-structured programs: statement grouping, decision making(if-else), selecting one of a set of possible cases (switch), looping with termination test at the top(while, for) or at the bottom (do),  and early loop exit (break).
